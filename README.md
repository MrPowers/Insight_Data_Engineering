Used latest python functional programming best practices to  to load and write csv. Efficient use of python in-built modules of operator, itertools, and collections. Efficient use of python data structures when needed, lists for sorting structure before itertools.groupby , tuple for implimenting counters as ordering is not important. Used yield to create a custom generator to send to csv.writerows (which is efficient as it is).
